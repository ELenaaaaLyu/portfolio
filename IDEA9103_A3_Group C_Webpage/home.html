            <p>This project is based on the immune system, and in the canvas you can see ordinary cells (circles), white
                blood cells (squares) and viruses (triangles). The process of cell division and decay can also be seen
                in the project, in addition to which the following rules are observed:</p>
            <p> 1. When the virus and white blood cells meet, they disappear together</p>
            <p> 2. When the number of viruses is greater than the number of white blood cells, ordinary cells also
                become viruses</p>
            <p>3. Ordinary cells and white blood cells split every 10s and decay every 5s
            </p>
            <p> You can also try sliding and clicking mouse to see if anything interesting happens!</p>
